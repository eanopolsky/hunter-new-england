<p>
His object of focus is an oily rag approximately 1 foot square, which
he found in the engine room of the ship that brought him across the
Atlantic. When <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> concentrates on it, the oil stains ripple and
dance in proportion to the distance between him and the unnatural
creature.

really was eaten by Marc's previous character Marcela), he decided to
seek revenge. Main skill is craft with weaponsmithing/robotics
specialties.

<p>
He has a safe house with a lab down in a creepy part of town full of
run-down warehouses. On the plus side, it has great sewer access.

</p>

<p>
Met a skeevy dude one night at the club Royale and finally figured out
what was wrong with him: the way he talked to girls and got them to
follow him into dark corners. One of them wound up dead and no one
could pin it on him, but she <i>knew</i> it was him. Wants to make women,
sex workers, and others in the club scene safer from people link him.

He confessed to 27 murders in 1896 and said similar things to Isaac

</p>

<p>
He was originally born in New Hampshire and executed by hanging in
Pennsylvania in 1896, but the murders took place in
Chicago. H. H. <a href="#orgdb0ed9e">Holmes</a>. He gave various contradictory accounts of his
life, first claiming innocence and then claiming he was possessed by
Satan. Some of the people he confessed to killing were verified as
still alive. The authorities only ever confirmed that he killed one,
and there are nine others they were fairly sure he killed. He built a
bizarre labyrinthine structure called the Murder Hotel. His last words
were well recorded: "take your time. Don't bungle it." <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>
remembers this was also something <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> said to the executioner.

<h4 id="orge058875"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.12</span> Isaac <a id="org3e7eb23">Sutton</a></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-12">
<p>
A crazed serial killer <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> helped to bring down. He brutally
murdered 17 women and confessed without any hesitation when
caught. Strange, mystical murder MO.
</p>

<p>
Execution video:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Most people making their last walk usually come in one of two ways:
quietly and resigned or sobbing as they are dragged into the chamber
by guards; Isaac <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> was neither of those. He strode into the
execution chamber confidently, with that same mask-like smile <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>
remembered from the day <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> and she had collared him. When the woman
who would have been his last victim escaped, <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> hadn‚Äôt gone on the
run. He had waited patiently, collating and arranging the trophies
he‚Äôd taken from the seventeen other women he‚Äôd killed and tidying up
his apartment; he‚Äôd even had tea brewing when <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> and Llayne
arrived. That afternoon had been surreal as he walked them through the
murders with the mundanity of a man discussing his office work as SWAT
kept the streets around his apartment building clear. Once he was
finally done, he had surrendered without incident‚Ä¶ all still wearing
that shit-eating smile.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúLlayne! I‚Äôm so thrilled you could attend,‚Äù <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> said when he caught
sight of <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> in the audience. ‚ÄúI was sad to hear you had left the
force; my condolences on the loss of your spouse ‚Äì I read the
obituary.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Not waiting for a reply, <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> continued as though holding
court. ‚ÄúAnd Detective <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> ‚Äì any new additions to the family since we
last saw one another? I believe it was four the last time we spoke.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúAssembled family members, members of the press, you have come today
to witness the end of Isaac <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>; to gain some degree of closure, I
suppose. Hopefully, this execution can provide that to you all, but no
matter what you do, it will not end the killings. Yours are not the
last sisters, daughters, wives, nieces‚Ä¶ what have you‚Ä¶ yours will not
be the last to die.‚Äù He sat down on the table, gesturing for the team
to begin their work. ‚ÄúAuch wenn mein Atem ruhig und mein Herz stehen
bleibt, kann mein Geist nicht r√ºckg√§ngig gemacht werden.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
They began strapping him to the table, but he continued speaking,
growing louder and seemingly more incoherent, or at least not speaking
in anything resembling a language <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> had heard before. He made
obvious efforts to looking out in <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>‚Äôs and Detective <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a>‚Äôs
direction as he spoke, cycling through different sounding gibberish
with each passing sentence.
</p>

<p>
When the attendant brought the needle for insertion, <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> paused
only for a moment to direct him to the right arm ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never liked
the way it feels on the left.‚Äù Satisfied, he continued speaking
gibberish, watching as the crew prepared the machines. Once the
executioner stepped forward, <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> stopped speaking. The man began to
read the pronouncement against <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>:
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúIsaac <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>, you were tried and found guilty of the premediated
murders of Emily Smith, Sarah Johnson, Samantha Williams, Lauren
Jones, Megan Brown, Amy Davis, Stephanie Miller, Rebecca Garcia,
Natalie Martinez, Heather Rodriguez, Elizabeth Wilson, Taylor
Anderson, Brittany Thompson, Madison Moore, Elizabeth Taylor, Rachel
Harris, and Natalie Lewis. You were also tried and found guilty of the
attempted murder of <a href="#org21adfb4">Melissa Baker</a>. A jury of your peers, in the US
District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston, sentenced
you to death by lethal injection; that sentence is to be carried out
today in accordance with that verdict and the laws of the United
States of America. Do you have any last words?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúTake your time. Don‚Äôt bungle it.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
With that, the executioner moved to start the machine. As the first
drug started to flow and <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> began to doze, he looked again in the
direction of <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> and Llayne. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you again,‚Äù he managed weakly
before drifting off into unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the proceeding was eerily quiet, precise, and banal,
despite being the end of a prolific serial killer. <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> did not
speak again, no signs of distress were noted once the anesthesia
agents were delivered, and the entire proceeding wrapped up within 30
minutes of beginning.

We're at <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a>'s safe house discussing what to investigate and decide to
start with <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a>. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> is able to touch base with some old CIs and
find him walking out of one of the lecture hall spaces on the
quad. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> and <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> approach him while <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a>, <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a>, and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> hang
back. It's been a long time since <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> has talked to a civilian and
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> looks pensive.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a> explains that ever since <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> got in with that asshole <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a>
(the hotshot dickbag from out west with an okie accent who runs a
modeling agency), she's always been out on calls. She can dance well
and has been dancing since high school. Now she's going to school for
it. <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a> was introduced to <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a> once. The fight between <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a> and
<a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> happened because <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a> was upset about never being able to spend
time with her.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> asks where <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> would meet <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a>. <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a> said <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a> gave
her a phone for him to get in touch with her. <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> never gave <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a>
the number.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> asks about <a href="#org982b521">Rina</a>. <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a> vaguely recalls hearing about her and
suggests talking to her roommates. <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> asks for <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a>'s last
name. It's "White." <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> asks for <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a>'s phone number and <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>'s
dorm address; he provides both. <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a> explains that <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a> looks a
good bit older than <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> with some gray in his hair and eyebrows,
good looking, crow's feet, carries himself well.

<h4 id="org4db1cf0"><span class="section-number-4">3.4.4</span> Checking the Dorm</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-4-4">
<p>
We all decide to go check out <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>'s dorm room. On the way, <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a>
explains she has a roommate named <a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a>. He's surprised she managed to
get a double room instead of a quad, which is more typical for
sophomores. It's a coed dorm in that it's a multi-story building and
the floors alternate genders. <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>'s room is on the second
floor. Outside, there's a whiteboard for both roommates. We knock, and
a young lady opens the door; she's tan with some Asian features. <a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a>
asks if he's found out anything about <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>.
</p>

<p>
Rules interlude: the current danger level is 1, so there is one black
die available. When using the danger die, they work like any other
die, unless they come up as a 1. If they come up as a 1, we can either
keep the success and increase the danger we are facing, or we can
choose to fail the roll and enter into despair.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a> explains that there are always people in and out at night,
especially <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>. <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a> or one of his people would come pick her up
at all hours, but usually evening work. The phone he gave her has been
going off non-stop for the last two weeks, but <a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a> didn't tell the
cops about it.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> asks how she acted after coming back from these outings. <a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a>
says she always came back tired, sometimes missing a couple days' of
class, but she was paid well.
</p>

<p>
Outside, <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> is tooling around with his surveillance drone. He
notices that the same long black car is driving by over and over. It
hasn't found a parking space and doesn't seem to be looking for
one. He zooms in behind it and gets a photo of the Illinois license
plate. It's a Mercedes E Class, jet black with tinted windows.
</p>

<p>
Back in the room, <a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a> rummages through the desk and pulls out a
2000-style flip phone. Contacts: <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a>, <a href="#orga4d9880">Mia</a>, <a href="#org5a50839">Milena</a>, <a href="#orgf0c3ede">Dan</a>, <a href="#orgf992c8c">Lilly</a>,
<a href="#orga7a424f">Rick</a>, and <a href="#orga74e5d5">Nicole</a>. <a href="#orga4d9880">Mia</a>'s text messages to the phone are "there in 5",
"there in 10", etc. We think this might be <a href="#orga4d9880">Mia</a> Groves from <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>'s
case. Messages from <a href="#orgf0c3ede">Dan</a>, <a href="#orgf992c8c">Lilly</a>, <a href="#orga7a424f">Rick</a>, <a href="#orga74e5d5">Nicole</a> include conversations:
"Have you met this person? What did you think of them? What did they
like?"

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> asks for the burner phone, and <a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a> gives it to her.
</p>

<p>
At a certain point, the messages become "wtf", "where r u?",
etc. Eventually there are calls from <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a>: "pick up the phone",
"you've got a gig". Finally there are messages from <a href="#org5a50839">Milena</a>: "why
aren't you answering <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a>?"
</p>

<p>
Upon receiving a text from <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> about a black car driving by over and
over, <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> steps into a bathroom stall and uses Sense Unnatural. He
detects that there is an unnatural creature within a city block, but
it's not a vampire. It might be a ghoul, and he tells the cell as much
via text.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> manages to get a clear-as-day picture of the driver, despite the
window tinting, as he flicks a cigarette out the window. He texts it
to us. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> shows it to <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a> and <a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a>. <a href="#org15eb7c0">Chad</a> doesn't know him, but
<a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a> thinks he's "<a href="#orgc30246e">George</a>" or "Ron." <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> gets <a href="#org1847bf0">Amari</a>'s phone number.
</p>

<p>
It's starting to get closer to dusk. We leave the building.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> steps out in front of the car, giving it enough space to
stop. The driver floors it and peels out of there; she's just barely
able to dodge.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> calls the owner of the Royale and asks if he's heard of <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a>
or the modeling agency. He hasn't.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> goes through the phone and looks for calls from <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a>. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>
considers having a police contact run the mystery car plates. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a>
considers doing some hacking and location tracking the contacts in
<a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>'s phone.

typically driven by <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a>. He's waiting at the front door. He explains
that this is <a href="#org21adfb4">Melissa Baker</a>'s house.
</p>

<p>
A number of years ago, <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> brought down Isaac <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>, who was
convicted of the serial murder of 17 women. <a href="#org21adfb4">Melissa Baker</a> would have
been the 18<sup>th</sup> but got away. <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> would use a confidence act to get
access to a home and brutally murder women at the residence. He was
executed about a week ago.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> explains that he got an anonymous call at his desk phone giving
him this address and telling him there would be something to find. The
remains of <a href="#org21adfb4">Melissa Baker</a> are arranged in her living room within a
circle that's been drawn in chalk and blood. This was Isaac's
MO. Vital organs have been surgically removed and placed in specific
patterns in circles drawn at the head, hands, and feet. There is a
syringe, which he left. He would normally knock victims out with an
anesthetizing agent. <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> takes pictures. The scene is perfect: it
contains details that were not released to the press and were only
discussed at trial, which was closed to the public.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Everyone with occult knowledge (all except <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>) roll intelligence +
occult to recognize what's going on. It's a magic divination circle to
see "within." It is correctly drawn. Some of the script is Enochian,
with most of the symbols in angelic script. <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> muses that <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>
might have been possessed by a demon who was released and found a new
host after his execution.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> goes out into the hallway with Detective <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> as we pore over
the circles to ask what's going on. If he and <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> hadn't watched
<a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> die a week ago, <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> would assume he had gotten out again. <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a>
confessed with pride for seven hours the day they caught him. Maybe
they missed a second whack job? He never talked about his reason for
doing these things. He would always carve out a piece of the vagus
nerve near the heart.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> and <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> remember <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> said something in German before he
died. They don't know what it meant, but they do know it was recorded
as part of the execution by the Bureau of Prisons. <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> asks for a
copy and <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> says he will get one. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> asks <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> to run the plate
we saw earlier. He says he'll also try to get a trace on the anonymous
call on his phone.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> heads off to the library. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> heads off to hack the phone at his
secret warehouse. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>, and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> go off to get a drink at
the Venu. That bloody scene brought back terrible memories for <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>,
and he's so ready to calm his nerves.

In his creepy factory lair, <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> attempts to hack <a href="#orga4d9880">Mia</a>, <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a>, and
<a href="#org5a50839">Milena</a> from <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>'s phone and is able to triangulate where phone
calls were made to a resolution of about 100 meters. <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a> and
<a href="#org5a50839">Milena</a>'s calls came from one of two locations almost all the time: a
brownstone on Beacon Street (not 358 Beacon St, maybe 2 Beacon
Street), and 5 Monument Square in Charlestown. Some of <a href="#orga4d9880">Mia</a>'s calls
came from the same two locations, but some calls came from Bottoms Up,
the drive bar on Pearl Street. <a href="#orga4d9880">Mia</a> is a lot more on the move than
<a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a> and <a href="#org5a50839">Milena</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> also runs the plate on the Mercedes E Class; it's registered to
Ani Aroynan Trust, Inc out of Chicago, IL, which is a conglomerate of
businesses in the Chicago area. They're construction, plumber, trades,
warehousing, etc. It's currently overseen by the Aroynan family headed
by "Don" <a href="#org5a50839">Milena</a> Aroynan.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> also runs the driver's photo through a reverse image search. He's
<a href="#orgc30246e">George</a> Bronson, originally from Vermont. He has a record: mostly
simple stuff like assault, burglary, and robbery. He's a career
criminal, but a petty criminal.

<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> makes it to his occult library and researches the pictures of the
circles from the crime scene with the help of his librarian friend
<a href="#org8cf8083">Misty</a>. It was some kind of divination and transmutation ritual:
taking the secrets within and converting them into something that can
be used and taken. He's coalescing something into one piece of the
body that he can then take away. They discuss the possibility that it
could be a demon that possessed <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> and now may be possessing
something else. <a href="#org8cf8083">Misty</a> mentions that demons are fallen angels, so they
can still write angelic, which would explain the script.

<a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>: "Is he still in his grave? Is his body accounted for?"
</p>

<p>
On the drive back to the safe house we drive by 2 Beacon Street and 5
Monument Square, the two locations where we know <a href="#org483a71a">Brayden</a> and <a href="#org5a50839">Milena</a>
hang out. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> is driving, <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> is casing the joint, and <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> is
taking pictures with his drone.
</p>

<p>
There are people milling around on the street outside the Monument
Square house. To the untrained eye, they look like neighborhood people,
but <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> can tell they're guards on patrol. There are cameras outside
the house, and the inside is lit up. She manages to get a few pictures
of the exterior and visible people. No flash.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> sees through a bay window with his drone; there are a handful of
people milling around in the front space. It looks like it would
normally be a dining area. Or, maybe he doesn't because the drone is
50&#x2013;100 feet in the air and it's not a fourth story window. There are
private garages.
</p>

<p>
We take a pass by the Beacon Street house. It's unlit, closed off and
dark. There aren't any obvious people out front.

Once we're back at the safe house, <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> gets the idea to research old
historical murders. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> offers to lead the action with <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> and
<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> assisting. <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>'s murders took place in the
Massachusetts/Vermont/New Hampshire area, so we limit our search to
the eastern US over the last 200 years.
</p>

<p>
We find one instance of a person confessing to 27 murders. He was
originally born in New Hampshire and executed by hanging in
Pennsylvania in 1896, but the murders took place in
Chicago. H. H. <a href="#orgdb0ed9e">Holmes</a>. He gave various contradictory accounts of his
life, first claiming innocence and then claiming he was possessed by
Satan. Some of the people he confessed to killing were verified as
still alive. The authorities only ever confirmed that he killed one,
and there are nine others they were fairly sure he killed. He built a
bizarre labyrinthine structure called the Murder Hotel. His last words
were well recorded: "take your time. Don't bungle it." <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>
remembers this was also something <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> said to the
executioner.

<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> texts <a href="#org45780a4">Reed</a> and asks him to check on <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>'s body.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a> didn't have any family, so he was cremated.</li>
<li>A link to the video that was sent to him by the Federal Bureau of
Prisons. See his NPC section for the description.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We translate the German phrase from the video into English: "Even if
my breath stops and my heart stops, my mind cannot be undone."
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> attempts to run <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>'s final muttered gibberish through
translation software with <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>'s help. There are at least 14
different languages mixed together. He's repeating the same phrase in
all of them: "Even if my breath stops and my heart stops, my mind
cannot be undone."

<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> asks <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> to find a way to protect the safe house from

car. As we drive by the Beacon Street house, <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> attempts to sense
the unnatural (under a poncho and behind tinted windows) but he either
fails or there is nothing unnatural nearby. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> sees there are black
vehicles out, which were not there last time; they have Illinois
plates and he gets pictures. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> sees cameras on the outside of the
house. The lighting fixtures have been fitted to include
cameras as well. There are marks in the yard indicating recently installed
invisible fencing for dogs. She recognizes one or two of the "locals"
from Monument Square last night are now "locals" at Beacon Street.

In the library, <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> is researching demons. There is information about
some general wards he might use to protect the safe house, but he
needs to know who he's trying to protect against to put up truly
effective protection. <a href="#org8cf8083">Misty</a> says she might know someone who could help
him get that information, help him cast the magic, etc.: Johan
<a href="#orgd0c9f0c">Ravenswood</a>, the proprietor of The Cauldron Black in Salem. If <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a>
tells him <a href="#org8cf8083">Misty</a> sent him, he'll show him more than he shows to
tourists. He thanks her and leaves. He sends a clumsy text to the
group: "I found out that I need more magic. I know where to go. Should
I go there or do you need my help where u r?"

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-5-7">
<p>
The Uber Black car makes its way to Most Precious Blood. It's a local
community church, which happens to be the place where <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>'s family
were parishioners. We stop and get out of the car. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> dismisses it
with the intention of getting another one later.
</p>

<p>
The inside isn't super opulent. This is an old red brick style
Catholic church. Inside, there's an older woman fiddling with a rosary
and talking with a man who's obviously a priest. He's speaking fairly
decent Spanish.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> approaches the priest and asks if they can speak somewhere
private. He offers his office. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> find their respective
restrooms. The priest has an office that's high quality but not
ostentatious. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> asks what the best way is to avoid getting
possessed by a demon, or to get rid of one. Father <a href="#orgd5944ad">Whitcomb</a> looks her
up and down and asks if it's for her or someone she knows. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> says
it's prevention for her and asks if he knows Enochian. He asks if the
person she's trying to help has seen a psychiatrist. She begins
telling the story of tracking the serial killer and he recognizes her
as Detective Llayne. 
</p>

<p>
He says he's fairly new at Precious Blood. The previous vicar, Father
Joseph <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a>, was asked to retire but he's still here in town. He
lives a couple of blocks away in the Everett Street
Theater. Apparently they asked him to step down because some odd
things have happened around the parish before and he didn't know when
to stop asking questions. Bishop Evans asked him to retire quietly
because Father <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> was spending more time on the kind of things the
church does not like to talk about instead of ministering to his
flock, putting the church in danger. Father <a href="#orgd5944ad">Whitcomb</a> explains that he,
on the other hand, was called to minister to the sick and the broken
rather than carrying the sword of the lord. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> asks him for a hug,
and they do.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> attempts to sense unnatural in the bathroom and detects
nothing.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> joins <a href="#orgd5944ad">Whitcomb</a> and <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> in the office and asks about
<a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>. He knows <i>of</i> her and has met the family after being in his
position for a few months but suspects Father <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> would know her
better. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> asks him for holy water. He doesn't know if his faith
is the type that can drive off the unnatural but offers to let her
fill a couple of vials from the basin. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>, just joining them in
the office, receives three small anointing oil vials and fills them
from the basin. We leave the church and start walking over to Everett
Street.

<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> finally makes it out of bumper to bumper traffic and reaches The
Cauldron Black. The front of the store a bit kitschy. Mr. <a href="#orgd0c9f0c">Ravenswood</a>'s
body cast is Max von Sydow. He recognizes <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> from wood chopping
tiktok, but <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> plays it off. <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> looks him up and down but doesn't
get the sense he's a supernatural creature. He name drops <a href="#org8cf8083">Misty</a> and
mentions he's here to talk about demons. <a href="#orgd0c9f0c">Ravenswood</a> calls Christina to
watch the counter for a while and leads <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> into the back. It's a
smaller room that looks a lot like <a href="#org8cf8083">Misty</a>'s library but more compact
and denser; there's no kitschy stuff back here. Jars full of
unmentionable organs and preservatives, books bound in not exactly
leather, that kind of thing. <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> is pretty sure that the study and
the amount of space he walked through to get there couldn't fit in the
store he just entered.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> shows him the notes, diagrams, history, pictures of the crime
scene circles, and <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>'s death quote. <a href="#orgd0c9f0c">Ravenswood</a> looks over the
photos on <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a>'s phone, which pings like it's giving <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> an alert but
nothing changes on the screen. They dance around the identity of the
killer, but <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> shares his theory that it's one demon possessing
multiple people over time. <a href="#orgd0c9f0c">Ravenswood</a> borrows his phone, hooks it up
to a computer, and prints out some of the pictures. He says he'll need
a day to analyze it. He's able to get <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a>'s name and number from the
device and confirms it with him.

We start on our way to the Everett Street Theater, which is two or

</p>

<p>
We talk about <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>'s distinctly cold bearing toward Father <a href="#orgd5944ad">Whitcomb</a>
during the last scene. She's upset with his victim blaming stance: if
those women hadn't gone to the places they'd gone, they'd be
fine. This helps no one.

<p>
We find an area that's been worked on a bit more, but not in a way
that's conducive to theater work; someone has set up a cage. We don't
see anyone right away thanks to the fencing and door, but Father
<a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> meets us at the gate.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> tells him we're investigating demons, murders, and missing
girls. After a little discussion, he lets us into what appears to be a
safe house. It has basic living area with a heavy, reinforced door,
some shelves with some old books, a workbench, papers, maps,
etc. There is a nice looking crucifix, a lathe, and some
forearm-length shafts of wood that have been sharpened to a point.
</p>

<p>
He shares that he knows a couple of girls went missing at a club. He
hasn't had the chance to talk with the Murphy family as he's no longer
with the church and he doesn't specifically know what happened to
<a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>. <a href="#org982b521">Rina</a> he's never heard of. He does know that a fair number of
night clubs in Boston are feeding grounds for&#x2026;not demons, but
something else.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> asks why <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> is no longer with the church. He explains that
they didn't like that others were asking questions about the things he
was asking questions about. He hasn't joined the wing of the church
concerned with monster hunters because they're more interested in
study and less interested in extermination. He suspects the church in
Boston is partially under the thumb of the undead.
</p>

<p>
He tells the story of his first fight in which he rescued a woman
running from a vampire near the church. He let her inside. The vampire
controlled the shadows and tried to cripple his mind, but he resisted.
</p>

<p>
He says he knows a lot about vampires, that he suspects <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> was
taken by vampires, and that he's focused on determining whether the
archdiocese is controlled by them as well.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> asks if he's familiar with <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>. <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> doesn't know him
personally, but came across his name by looking over the movers and
shakers in the club scene that seem to be connected to disappearances.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> asks if he knows about the Order of the <a href="#org55378dc">Black Dragon</a> or <a href="#org1d8d841">DJ
Grimga</a>. He's heard the latter name. <a href="#org1d8d841">DJ Grimga</a> moonlights as a DJ but
he's actually a classical guitar player&#x2014;latin jazz. His real name is
Lajuan Loisel, a Haitian kid. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> asks, but <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> doesn't know if
he performs during the day; techno isn't his thing.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> reminisces about sitting down with <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> and her parents for
some counseling after she got caught shoplifting at the mall. Other
than that, she kept her nose clean, she paid attention, she seemed
earnest. He never got the impression that she was just going through
the motions.

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> asks him about H. H. <a href="#orgdb0ed9e">Holmes</a>. He's heard the name but doesn't
know much else. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> brings up <a href="#org3e7eb23">Sutton</a>. He's heard of him but doesn't
know the details. We share that we think he's a demon, but <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> has
his doubts. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> shows him a photo of <a href="#org21adfb4">Melissa Baker</a>'s murder scene on
his phone. <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> pulls out a book.
</p>

<p>
Char returns.
</p>

<p>
Half of the book is written in roman lettering, but some of it looks
like the symbols from the murder circle. He explains that inscribed in
the circle are ten different names. He says we're <i>sort of</i> right
about it being related to a demon. The ten names are found in various
books of the Jewish Kabbalah, known collectively as the Grigori. He
explains that the wickedness that god was upset about (before Noah's
flood) had to do with angels coming to earth and having children with
human women. They also taught humans magic, enchantment, how to make
knives and swords, astrology, meteorology, writing with ink and paper,
the ways of war, and reading the signs of the moon. Many of the
learnings that the church holds to be secular, venial knowledge
actually came from the Grigori. They were punished by god as most
demons were. They were not confined to hell, not allowed to return to
heaven, and not allowed to retain their physical form.
</p>

<p>
The watchers were bound in the valleys of the earth physically, but
that only lasted so long. At least some of them figured out how to get
out of that body. Now they roam the earth as something not angel,
demon, or ghost&#x2026;but other.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> doesn't know why the names are inscribed in the circle. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>
asks if he knows of a way to keep the Grigori from coming back. He
doesn't know. God specifically tried to wipe out the Nephalem, the
children of humans and angels, in Noah's flood. He offers to write
down the names of the Grigori/"chiefs":
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

shows <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> the grainy photo he got from the rehab center security
camera of his sister's killer. <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> has seen her before; she's shown
up in a couple of other pieces of surveillance associated with other

<li><a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> shared that Father <a href="#orgd5944ad">Whitcomb</a>'s victim blaming attitude doesn't

<li>Everyone but <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> met Joseph <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a>, former vicar of Most Precious
Blood and current vampire hunter in his Everett Street Theater
safehouse. We learned that he's currently working on uncovering
vampiric infiltration into the church.</li>
<li>He also told us that <a href="#org1d8d841">DJ Grimga</a>'s real name is Lajuan Loisel, a
classical guitar player who moonlights as a DJ.</li>
<li><a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> looked at the crime scene photos from <a href="#org21adfb4">Melissa Baker</a>'s murder
and told us that the words inscribed in the circles are the names of
the Grigori, a group of angels who visited earth, got busy, incurred
god's wrath, and ended up with no return ticket to heaven.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> helped <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> identify Marcela, the vampire who killed

<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> had a scene between sessions 3 and 4. Things were dicey for a
moment, but now they're fine. He dove out through a second story
window and has corresponding cuts and bruises.

<p>

<a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> disappeared.

<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> shows up at Memoir in a great suit but with tape over his
nose. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> shows up in an Uber wearing forgettable but
club-appropriate clothes. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> shows up wearing all black, but with
just a hint of color where the shirt meets the pants. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> and
<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> arrive together.

We head up to the door together. The bouncers are not the normal
people and tell <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> they're fairly certain she's not on the
list. She asks to speak to the manager by their first name. It's <a href="#org9caebed">Remi</a>,
the head of the Order of the <a href="#org55378dc">Black Dragon</a>. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> talks him into
letting us in but cautions her to stay out of the VIP area where
<a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> is. <a href="#org9caebed">Remi</a> tells us that <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> said <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> would be nosing
around and didn't want her here.

<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> heads to the bar, gets a glass of whiskey, heads over to a booth,
and rubs some of it into his arm. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> mingles, gets a drink, and
joins us after a minute. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> grabs a martini that goes with her
dress and circles the room looking for <a href="#orga4d9880">Mia</a>. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> heads off to the
bathroom, detects vampires, and finds nothing, and comes back to the
table with a drink.
</p>

<p>
We discussed (out of character) who in the cell has seen <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a>'s photo
of Marcela. So far only <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> rescues <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> from the dance floor where he looks supremely
uncomfortable. After his sunset shirt slips into view, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> takes
some safety pins out of her clutch and, without asking, pins his suit
jacket together to hide it.
</p>

<p>
We exchange notes. <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> rolls up a sleeve and shows off some cuts that
he has sewn up. He's been on the receiving end of a beating, but
clearly came out on the winning side. He shows off a bleeding cut on
his forearm, which he sutured shut himself. He's worried about his
tattoos, but <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> reassures him that it's going to heal straight.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> explains that a while ago he beat up a scumbag that was trying to
Bill Cosby people, but who turned out to be a member of the mob. His
muscle abducted <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> and asked him to make it easier to Bill Cosby
people, so he crushed them and came over.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>: "You flipped the table on the Patriarchas family? I've been
wanting to do that for years."
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> explains to <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> that he shouldn't be doctoring his wounds in
public.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> looks around. Nobody is paying us any undue attention.

<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> suggests getting access to security cameras to watch <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>.
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> pulls <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> to the back office with purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> decides to try to cause a distraction to assist them. He heads
out onto the dance floor with the intention to punch people
out? Because <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> asked her to run interference, <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> runs out
onto the dance floor and attempts to dance between <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> and other
people. <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> sees a couple of people who are vaguely familiar from his
adventure at the warehouse earlier and tries to create an altercation
with them by cutting in when they're trying to talk to people. One of
them eventually throws a punch when he references their boss. He leans
into it while <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> tries to push him out of the way. Bouncers
descend and throw all three of them out.
</p>

<p>
Outside, <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> warns the mobster to stay out of these bars. It
escalates to threats and <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> knees in him in the face, breaking his
nose and knocking him out. <a href="#orgf472bb2">Rudy</a> explains he's a human trafficker, and
<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> knees the unconscious man in the nuts.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> and <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> make their way into the back but find there is one guy
left in the camera room. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> bluffs that there's an issue with the
technology that's interfering with the DJ and gets him to leave. They
go outside and talk shop while <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> works. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> writes a back door
that will allow him access to the security system later on. He then
heads outside. On his way out, he uses a credit card to keep the door
from locking, waits a moment, and slips back in.

<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> gets up and does some dancing while keeping an eye out for any
predators on the dance floor. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> joins him. After a while, <a href="#org1d8d841">DJ
Grimga</a> takes a break, and <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> head over to talk with
him. He's seated at a table in the back of the booth with a drink.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> hands him a card and compliments him on his great set. He
explains he has an exclusive arrangement with another promoter. She
asks him about being at Royale and asks if he met <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> or <a href="#org982b521">Rina</a>. He
seems earnest in denying that he knows anything about it or had
anything to do with it. He does most of his work through
<a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> gets one of his cards. We leave.

<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> charms the bartender and escorts <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> through back of the
club, through the kitchen, and up some stairs to the back entrance to
the VIP room. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> shows <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> a picture of <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> on her phone and

<p>
It's much quieter in the VIP room. There are a handful of people:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Vance <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a></li>
<li>A couple of girls. They're talking with each other and looking at
Vance and <a href="#org9caebed">Remi</a>.</li>
<li>One or two people who are obviously muscle.</li>
<li>A couple of other older people who look <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>'s apparent age,
including <a href="#org9caebed">Remi</a>. Another is a woman with striking white hair and
eyebrows.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The vibe is more relaxed; it feels more like business than a
party.
</p>

<p>
Vance and white haired woman are talking quietly. After a moment, the
white haired woman asks <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> his name and what he does for a living,
and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> answers using his mask.
</p>

<p>
She eventually says to <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>, "you should come here and sit by me,"
and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> is barely able to resist what is clearly a supernatural
command. He gives her his card as cover for walking partway to her and
leaves through the obvious exit: the stairs back to the club. She
looks a little disappointed when <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> excuses himself, but is not
obviously angry or anything. He hits the restroom to substantiate his
cover for wandering into the VIP room, heads outside, and texts the
rest of the cell to let them know what happened.

<a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> downloads the video and deletes the originals with aplomb. While
doing so, he notices that someone else has already accessed them and
taken a copy off the server. Uh oh.
</p>

<p>
We look over the VIP room footage. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> carefully inspects <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>'s
vampire friend. She looks a lot like <a href="#org72804a7">Katarina</a> Iverson, who was
significant in the history of a bank in the area, except <a href="#org72804a7">Katarina</a>
would have to be way older than that by now. It must be her niece or
granddaughter&#x2026; Iverson Bank is a capable investment bank in the
northeast. Christopher Iverson runs it now.
</p>

<p>
In the video, once <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> bumbles down the stairs, the interaction
between the woman and <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> changes entirely. Without <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a>'s lip
reading software, she comes to full height, and <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> seems
apologetic and deferential. She's wildly gesticulating down the
stairs. <a href="#org9caebed">Remi</a> comes back in, she looks at him, and he gets a little
rigid for a moment. He turns and heads off down the stairs. Some
people come in from the club's bouncer crew. They were bouncers from
the club, but not the guards at 5 Monument Square or 2 Beacon
Street. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a>, reading their lips, doesn't see anything like
"<a href="#org72804a7">Katarina</a>" being said, but <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> refers to her at one point as
<a href="#orgf723026">Hazel</a>. At no point does she ever see the name "Vance" spoken, but the
vamp does say "how the fuck did he get in here, Richard?" to him.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org1d8d841">DJ Grimga</a> comes up to the VIP room on his next break. His demeanor is
very deferential as well. "<a href="#orgf723026">Hazel</a>" is clearly interrogating him. She
throws her hands up and leaves through the back doors. Everyone left
is glad it's over, but there is still an obvious tension.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, the two of them are having a conversation, but not in
English. After a few minutes, <a href="#org1d8d841">DJ Grimga</a> goes back downstairs. <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>
pulls out a cell phone and makes a call. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> gets a few fragments
of conversation.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> attempts to write a lip reading program. He does well, but raises
the danger level to 3. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org72804a7">Katarina</a>/<a href="#orgf723026">Hazel</a>: "How the fuck did that guy get in here."
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>: "I don't know, my prince."
</p>

<p>
We rolled occult, but none of us know what this means.
</p>

<p>
We decided that "dumping the trucks" is in-universe slang for getting
the video. 
</p>

<p>
They don't have names, but they do know that <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> made it into the
club. When <a href="#org1d8d841">DJ Grimga</a> comes up, they ask whether "Emem" knows
them. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> thinks this could be Emem Lewis, who runs a number of
jazz clubs throughout Boston.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> and <a href="#org1d8d841">DJ Grimga</a> switch over to French after <a href="#org72804a7">Katarina</a> leaves. <a href="#org1d8d841">DJ
Grimga</a> tells <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> that we were asking after <a href="#org982b521">Rina</a> and <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>: "Do you think they made you?" 
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org1d8d841">DJ Grimga</a>: "I don't think so."
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>'s call: "Pull those two girls aside in my office. I'll be there
in fifteen."
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> sets up a phishing scheme and targets <a href="#org9caebed">Remi</a>, which he totally
falls for. We'll resolve this later.

Shannon mentioned he has mechanics for breaking down masks. They're
"extended tests", and each roll takes a week.

We talked about how we might reconcile the fact that the mechanics
call for the danger level to be reset to 1 after completing a hunt,
but completing a hunt would absolutely drive vampires into a rage and
motivate them to destroy us. Marc thought that we might do a really
good job and clean up our mess, or we might make our baseline danger
level a 2. Shannon thought we might handle the issue by laying low for
a while after resolving the <a href="#org982b521">Rina</a>/<a href="#org4790349">Regina</a> mystery, resetting the danger
level. I really liked Shannon's solution because it not only takes
into account the fact that vampires (and other supernatural beings)
will surely have a huge set of pressing concerns that would naturally
distract them from us, but also that "laying low" could be used to
keep the game calendar in sync with real life.
</p>

<p>
We discussed changes to the safe house. We agreed to improve it from a
one dot (small) safe house to a two dot (good size) in exchange for
taking the one dot haunted flaw. We will decide later about the nature
of the haunting. Ghosts and hellmouths were discussed as options. Marc
does not want a TARDIS-like environment.
</p>

<p>
We discussed (possibly for the first time?) safety tools. See <a href="#org41e719d">2.1</a>.

number, but he <a href="#org9caebed">Remi</a> did, and now we do. A quick survey of Vance online
shows he doesn't have a social media presence. It's all canned,
boilerplate content with a contact form so they can get back to

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-9-5">
<p>
We make some occult rolls. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> knows sunlight is bad for
vampires. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> thinks stakes through the heart might be helpful but
isn't completely sure how; he remembers that Father <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> had a few
on hand. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> knows that fire harms vampires.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> calls <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> and lets him know that we've identified the vampire
responsible for kidnapping <a href="#org982b521">Rina</a> and <a href="#org4790349">Regina</a>. He explains that stakes
won't kill vampires but will stop them if we get through the heart. He
also suggests going in while it's light because while they might still
wake up, they're generally a lot slower. Some are capable of doing
things to people while the vampire is asleep.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> asks about <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> calling <a href="#orgf723026">Hazel</a> "prince". <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> grows quiet
for a moment and asks us to repeat ourselves. When he's sure that's
what we said, he explains that vampires organize themselves in a
structure feudal in nature. The "prince" is the leader of a city. Some
gain that position because they are old and powerful, others because they are
well-connected and shrewd. Regarding stakes, any wood will do.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> asks about archery or crossbows. <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> says they work, but the
danger is they may pass all the way through the vampire.
</p>

<p>
We all chip in XP to buy <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> as a cell ally:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3XP from <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a></li>
<li>3XP from <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a></li>
<li>6XP from <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a></li>
<li>6XP from <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
It cost exactly 18XP to buy him, so we agreed that <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>
(who paid less) will pony up to improve the safe house.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> is persuasive, polite, has a dot of medicine, and has 3 dots of occult.
He also has sense unnatural (handsfree, short range). He can repel as
a ward, has a library and has True Faith 3.

<p>
We tell Father <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> to meet us at a third location so we can pick
him up and drive him there. We manage to pick up Father <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> at a

isn't broken. Incredible. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> and <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> also get them.

<p>
We stop at Ringgold Park and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> reaches out to sense the
unnatural, but senses nothing. We head to Watson Park and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>
repeats the ritual for a point of willpower, which we learned we can
apparently gain back pretty easily. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> detects a vampire within a

discovers that <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>'s phone is at 25 Milford Street precisely.

<p>
<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> finds that the front door is unlocked, and we breeze inside to
find a small alcove entryway. The door in front of us has a slide that
would allow people on the inside to see us if they wish, but there is
not so much as a handle on the outside. There is, however, a camera
pointed right at us. A guard opens the slide and questions us. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>
bluffs about working for the gas company&#x2014;we need to get inside right
away or an overpressure issue will cause an explosion.
</p>

<p>
Inside, we find a black and red motif. The windows are blacked out
completely. Other than that, it almost looks like an office reception
area. The receptionist is dressed like the splicers from Bioshock but
with clothing in good repair, including a maid's outfit and a
mask. The three extremely burly guards have similar masks but are
otherwise dressed normally.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> asks <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> ("Jerry") if he has the shutoff wrench in his
bag. He does. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> asks <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> ("Robert") to let the rest of the team
know we may need help. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a> texts <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> and <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> to let them know
it's time to join us.
</p>

<p>
We get to the bottom of the basement stairs to something that looks
like a kitchen space. There is a door off the space at the bottom of
the stairs to the basement. Behind that is the mechanical chase. <a href="#orgac4bf5e">Greg</a>
turns some valves to full open and tries to hide it, which he doesn't,
but manages to play it off.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> and <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> come in through the still unbolted door. They notice
that, as soon as they hit the stairwell, one of the guards starts
heading into the back of the first floor. He may have made one of
them.
</p>

<p>
They bring us deeper into the basement space through something that
looks like a lab, to a set of doors that looks like they lead
outside&#x2026;except it's a basement. There's a storage area and what can
only be characterized as a garage. There is an exterior door beyond
that. It looks like an old subway tunnel, but it's under the back
yard. <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> realizes this is part of the old subway system under
Boston, which must be how people have been getting in and out unobserved.
</p>

<p>
We give each other the look. It's time to take out the guard. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>
decks him in the back of the head with brass knuckles for 7, and
<a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> hits him for 4 with a bat. As he falls, <a href="#orgf99ce8a">Mazone</a> stakes him
through the heart, and the wound runs with hot blood.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-1">
<blockquote>
<p>
The service corridors of Memoir were strangely industrial compared to
the bright neon dance floor. Following half a pace behind <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>,
<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> took in the spartan paint job and long, bare fluorescent bulbs
that tickled something at the edge of his mind. The back entrance to
the VIP room appeared in front of him and he stepped through, but
instead of an array of elegant furniture, expensive champagne, and
mood lighting, he saw only darkness. The bass thumping of the club
faded away, making room for the hiss and rumble of the Merinkov's
steam engines.
</p>

<p>
He wasn't alone in the darkness. He must have dropped a scavenged tin
of tuna or a blanket in the corridor leading down to the burning guts
of the steamship's engine room because he knew, even though his eyes
had not yet adjusted, that the predator was here too. His lips parted
in a silent prayer that it wouldn't dare get close enough to the
boiler to look behind it where he stood, even as his shaking hands
drew the flare gun from the folds of his sleeping bag and trained it
on the strip of deeper darkness where the gap between the boiler and
the bulkhead opened into the greater space of the engine room.
</p>

<p>
He held his breath. One second. Two seconds. Was that the sound of
soft footfalls in the engine room? Three seconds. Four seconds. Did he
hear quiet sniffing, like an animal scenting the air? Five
seconds. Six. And then, suddenly, a pair of glowing red eyes slid into
view, staring directly at him.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> fought down panic. He could depend on the gun, and he could
depend on the blazing metal of the boiler. Children of Caine feared
the charring of their flesh just as humans did, only moreso having
peeked beyond the veil of death and seen the fate awaiting their
damned souls. The thing peered through the gap at him. Sooner or later
the sun would rise and compel the unnatural thing back to wherever it
slept, and then it would be <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>'s turn to hunt. He raised the flare
gun in silent challenge, but instead of taking cover behind the
boiler, the creature smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Come here," it whispered from the darkness. "Sit by me."
</p>

<p>
Not in a million years, <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> thought, even as he turned and pushed
himself to his feet. He stared forward in horror as his unwilling legs
brought him closer and closer to the creature waiting for him at the
gap, and its smile widened. The round, red, ravenous eyes blazed in
the darkness. Its smile parted into a fanged grin too beastly to be
human's as a line of bright hellfire bloomed across its forehead,
forming a solid line from left to right. Blood red, demonic runes
scribbled themselves into existence across its cheeks and lips and
tongue, twisting into alien and yet somehow familiar shapes. <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a>
drew a breath that would become a scream as his body lurched closer to
the increasingly inhuman face. He was almost exposed. Any second the
creature would reach an arm in for him, grab his collar, yank him into
the open, and drink from him until his vision faded to black. His
finger wouldn't move on the trigger of the flare gun. He could smell
the breath of the grave against his face as the two glowing red eyes
grew larger and larger.
</p>

<p>
But they weren't eyes.
</p>

<p>
The red colon of his bedside alarm clock glowed in his vision. It was
1:57 in the morning, and the pillow under his left ear was drenched
with sweat. Now fully awake, <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> exhaled heavily and rolled onto
his back, his heart pounding in his chest as his memories separated
and jelled. The steamship was years in the past, and the vampire that
had stalked him there never found his hiding place. The woman, the
white haired vampire in the VIP room at Memoir, was the one who had
seen him and nearly ensnared his mind.
</p>

<p>
Not for the first time, <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> thought about running. His car was
parked outside with a full tank of gas, and he knew where he could get
a new identity. He could drive until the sun came up, and then keep
driving until all of this was just a memory. Except it wouldn't
work. Sooner or later, wherever he ended up, another girl would go
missing at a night club, or on a backpacking trip, or just walking
home from work, and <a href="#org7b24d40">Andrei</a> would be back on the street, hiding in the
shadows and listening. The world was infested with fiends, and his
only choice was to let them consume him or purge their kind with fire.

<blockquote>
<p>
Leah's eyes were glazing over and she could feel herself slumping
lower and lower in her chair.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> had invited her to shadow her work this week - something about
planning for when her dancing and DJing days were behind her - but it
was a lot more phone calls and paperwork and a lot less clubbing then
Leah had expected. In fact, by the time they went out in the evening,
she was kind of exhausted from the day. No wonder <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> constantly
caffeinated.
</p>

<p>
This man had been here every day for the past four days. Something
about licensing. Who knows? Who cares?
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> was listening intently, leaning forward with her elbows on her
desk, brow furrowed. She always did that ‚Äì even with the most boring
and stupid things, she could make you feel like you were the most
important person in the world.
</p>

<p>
The man finally stopped his droning. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> leaned back, steepling her
hands as she always did when she was in thought and asked gently, ‚ÄúSo
what would you have us do Asif?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
The man sighed, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know darlin'.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
At this Leah snapped alert and clenched her jaw, staring daggers into
the back of this man‚Äôs head. She hated it when men called <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>
cutesy nicknames. She knew better than to react out loud though. There
was nothing <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> took more seriously than her job.
</p>

<p>
Exhausting, frankly. Leah knew, of course, that the people calling
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> these nicknames were doing so out of misplaced affection but
&#x2026; Fuck, it still rankled.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> asked the man to give her three days to which he nodded
gratefully before leaving and giving Leah a short wave on the way out.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> stood up, smiled apologetically at Leah and stuck her head
outside the office and once satisfied there was nobody else waiting,
told her slightly star-struck new assistant, a young person with a
shock of blue hair and stylish glasses, to take a break.  .  ‚ÄúCan we
go?‚Äù ‚Äì Leah instantly regretted her tone. She hadn‚Äôt meant to sound
impatient.  <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> looked back over her shoulder at her, a little
startled, ‚ÄúOh.. er.. yes, of course. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù  They exited the
offices, adjusting their coats and purses.
</p>

<p>
Entering the small bistro at the foot of the building, they were
escorted to a table reserved for them, because of course it was
thought Leah wryly.
</p>

<p>
Leah ordered a Cobb salad and a glass of white wine. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> got the
daily chef‚Äôs special - she always got the special if there was
one. ‚ÄúGives me variety and it‚Äôs what‚Äôs freshest!‚Äù, she said - today it
was mushroom pasta. Stupid dancer's metabolism, thought Leah, a little
jokingly, a little not.
</p>

<p>
They made small talk till the food got there. Right after they
ordered, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> gave the server her card as if to say she didn't want
to have the argument later. Leah would have only offered a cursory
objection anyway. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> knew that but the delusion suited them
both. As she opened her wallet, Leah glimpsed a picture of a handsome,
slightly smirking‚Ä¶ Filipino?&#x2026; man with major tattoos up his
neck. She almost asked about him this time. Almost.
</p>

<p>
Once the food was served, among the gentle tinkling of their own
cutlery and that of the tables near them, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> delicately twirled
the long noodles on her fork and asked, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ are you nervous about
talking to Rolf next week?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Leah snorted, ‚ÄúWhy should I be nervous?‚Äù She chuckled to herself
glibly and playing with her food a little, went on: ‚ÄúI just hope they
don‚Äôt make me audition or anything.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Leah looked up to see slight irritation on <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>‚Äôs face, so she
hastily added, ‚Äú.. because I'm going on your recommendation.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
And just then‚Ä¶ Something snapped.
</p>

<p>
Everything soft was gone in an instant, and its place ‚Äì hard
unyielding edges.  .  <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> put her fork down, leaned forward and
hissed through gritted teeth, clearly taking very great care to keep
her volume low, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with you?! If they ask you to
audition, it's only because I cannot be there to watch your back and
they need to make sure you are officially in their charge.. Like on
fucking paper&#x2026; If you die or get hurt, someone needs to know it's
your body Leah! You know what‚Äôs been happening! We can‚Äôt be as easy as
we used to be!‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Leah started.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> put up a finger, adopting her don‚Äôt-talk-back-to-me look Leah
knew well.  Leah stopped talking, shocked into silence. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> was
talking slower now, but her eyes blazed with anger, ‚ÄúYou always do
this Leah, you never think.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Leah looked at her plate sullenly, embarrassed at being dressed down
like a child.
</p>

<p>
After a beat, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>'s tone softened a little, as it always did when
she took a moment. "Leah.. I know you are brave and smart and
competent and&#x2026; Leah, look at me‚Ä¶ just remember that me and Rolf
and.. and.. " <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> trailed off. She cleared her throat and
continued, "When we send women to work at the clubs, we have been able
to guarantee your safety less and less. I cannot&#x2026;" She trailed off
again, reaching across and squeezing Leah's hand. Her tone softened
considerably more as she continued, now looking away and not making
eye contact, jaw clenching and unclenching, "Nothing can happen to
you."
</p>

<p>
This time it's Leah who has conviction in her voice when she puts a
hand on top of <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>'s freshly manicured one, "Nothing's going to
happen to me. I'm going to be fine. It's just a gig, like any other,
and I know how to be safe."
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> looked up at her, smiling sadly. "Of course you do, Lele."
</p>

<p>
Leah blushed, smiling embarrassedly, ‚ÄúI hate when you call me that.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> clears her throat again and leans back, picking up her
fork. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what do you think you‚Äôll do if they want an audition?‚Äù

On again/off again bf) (CW: Light flirting)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> had met Kai Estacado - half Japanese, half Mexican, with shaggy
hair and shaved sides (that you could uncharitably call a mullet), an
upper body full of tattoos, and a deep scar over one eye that he never
talked about - all broad angles and quiet stoicism - through some
aspiring models. Generally, the fitness classes they were into were
all some version of yoga and pilates, designed for long, lithe, soft
bodies. Kai focussed on strength and while the models credited him for
their powerful leg muscles and ability to navigate sky-high heels so
much easier, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> found herself really enjoying the process of
getting stronger, not slimmer or prettier. She started paying for
private lessons with him and was now, on most days, his first class of
the day. And they had transitioned from just strength-training to
including basic unarmed capoeira-style combat, at her request.
</p>

<p>
This morning, as the sun is just rising outside this small gym with
various strength-building equipment lining the walls - weights,
medicine balls, resistance bands - Kai is wrapping his hands. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs
spar,‚Äù he says.
</p>

<p>
She cocks her head, confused but amiable. This wasn‚Äôt their routine,
‚ÄúUh.. sure? ‚Ä¶ spar?"
</p>

<p>
He smiles - small, crooked and unexpected - and shrugs off his jacket,
revealing muscled, tattooed arms. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Pushing down her impulse to stare, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> smiles back and wraps her
hands up before adjusting her stance and putting her weight on her
back foot and her hands up. She watches Kai do the same.
</p>

<p>
When they first sparred, she was awkward and graceless and ended up
being knocked over constantly. But now, she ducks and weaves, using
the control of her body from her dancer days, and his teachings to
block and trade jabs expertly, weight shifting from back to front foot
with ease. The intensity of the sparring amps up and they are both
starting to sweat and breathe a little heavier.
</p>

<p>
Kai darts in, and <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> jumps backward, her heart
leaping as she feints out of his grip. She sees a bright, excited
glint in his eyes and that rare smile he gets sometimes pulling at his
lips. This is turning into a bit of a game.
</p>

<p>
When he darts in again, she tries to jump out of his way again but
this time, she made the mistake of trying to go past him, to round on
him from behind. He catches her mid movement, his arm hooking around
her middle. She gasps, unable to stop from laughing a little and
cursing ‚ÄòFuck!‚Äô as he turns and pulls her into a grapple, holding her
tightly against him, facing away from him.
</p>

<p>
He doesn‚Äôt let go right away. She can feel his chest rising and
falling as he catches his breath; <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>‚Äôs shoulders shake with
laughter as she‚Äôs still hinged over his arms.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúDo you know what mistake you made?‚Äù He asks quietly, and even though
he is effectively whispering in her ear, his tone is that
Kai-The-Instructor one that makes her laughing subside.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúI tried to pass you?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúYou tried to pass me,‚Äù Kai echos. He releases her, and as she turns
to face him, she sees his face is uncharacteristically red. ‚ÄúTry
again,‚Äù he says, all business.
</p>

<p>
He raises his hands once more, and <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> does the same. It takes on
the same tenor as before - a slow rise in intensity, darts and feints,
and this time, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> manages to jump away. Kai whirls around, his
dart having missed its mark, and smiles a broad, genuine
smile. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAgain.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
An hour goes by, at the end of which both Kai and <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> are panting
and sweating and beginning to slow. This time, Kai does catch her in
one of his darting movements. He doesn‚Äôt let go of her as he mutters,
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tiring.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
She pants, trying to catch her breath, turning her head to look up at
him behind her, ‚ÄúSo are you.‚Äù They lock eyes, the two of them staring
at one another for a long heart-pounding moment.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> starts to pull away and suddenly she is very aware of Kai‚Äôs
warm hand enveloping her own. She had always been ashamed of her
hands - they were the hands of a worker, not a dancer. She had taken
to always having her nails done to manufacture at least some of the
finesse she felt she lacked.
</p>

<p>
But Kai did not flinch as she did to herself. Without realizing it‚Äôs
even happening, she sweeps her thumb along the side of his
hand. ‚ÄúEnough now,‚Äù she mumbles.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúYes. Enough.‚Äù He agrees gently, releasing <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> and stepping back.
</p>

<p>
She looks at him and he looks weirdly embarrassed, like he's been
caught doing something he shouldn't. Still she is not ready for this
moment to end. ‚ÄúWanna grab breakfast?‚Äù she asks with feigned
casualness.
</p>

<p>
<i>he‚Äôs gonna say no he‚Äôs gonna say no he‚Äôs gonna say no you‚Äôre so stupid
he‚Äôs just your teacher</i>
</p>

<p>
There is a beat of unbearable silence before he smiles shyly,
"Alright."

<blockquote>
<p>
It‚Äôs dark as Em‚Äôs let into the VIP, having talked the bouncer into
letting her boyfriend in too. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> has a table in the back, sitting
alone, and is watching them walk up, a scowl deepening on her face as
they approach.
</p>

<p>
Oh fuck, something‚Äôs up, Em realized, but she‚Äôs already taken some K
and isn‚Äôt fully cogent - but she‚Äôs not stupid either.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> doesn‚Äôt say anything when they approach, clearly waiting for
Em, or her boyfriend, to say something first. ‚ÄúH..hi babe,‚Äù offers Em,
trying to de-escalate whatever this was.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> hisses back - there it is - ‚Äú ‚ÄòBabe‚Äô? Who the fuck is this?‚Äù
she gestures aggressively with her chin. Em uncomfortably puts an arm
through his and pulls him forward a step, ‚ÄúThis.. this is my
boyfriend‚Ä¶ Rayan.‚Äù He gives a short wave, and stretches his lips into
a smile, visibly uncomfortable and not quite sure what the other shoe
was, but clearly smart enough to know it was dropping.
</p>

<p>
Em sits down, not waiting to be invited, ‚ÄúWe just want some
molly. That‚Äôs all. Nothing crazy.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> laughs, clipped, sardonic: ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm selling to you now?
What‚Äôs my rule, Em? What‚Äôs my one fucking rule?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
A lightbulb goes off for Em and she responds, almost cheerfully at
knowing she got the answer right, ‚ÄúNo one else. No boyfriends, no
friends, no one.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> leans back and says quietly, looking at the young man, ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Rayan whispers loudly at Em, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. Let‚Äôs just go. We can get
molly somewhere else.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Em ignores him and looks at <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> blankly, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not fucking
serious?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> doesn‚Äôt move, her expression unflinchingly neutral, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too
bad, I got it from my cop friend too so it‚Äôs the real good stuff. The
stuff the families sell.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Em continues to look at her, her expression changing to incredulity,
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fucking bitch!‚Äù
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> shrugs.
</p>

<p>
Rayan is physically pulling at Em now and in a huff a few moments
later, they‚Äôve left the VIP.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> beckons one of the bouncers over and says quietly to him,
‚ÄúDarren, pull Andre off of VIP duty when I‚Äôm back here, he fucked up
tonight and I can‚Äôt have that.‚Äù Darren nods, understanding without
needing further instruction - that‚Äôs why she fucking loved him. ‚ÄúAlso,
get someone to watch Em tonight. If she or her boyfriend try to buy,
make sure you know who its from. We should know everyone here anyway.‚Äù
Darren nods again. ‚ÄúAnything else?,‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúNo. How‚Äôs the little
one?‚Äù ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good,‚Äù he smiles. ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> smiles and leans back
again, picking up her club soda. God, she hated drug duty.

You sit at a table at some shitty bar, absently twirling a glass in
your hand. Some guy tried to talk to you. You told him to fuck off. He
did, after calling you a bitch. He‚Äôs been looking over his shoulder at
you and glaring, getting increasingly, visibly angry.  Whatever. You
can‚Äôt even pretend right now.
</p>

<p>
The club.
</p>

<p>
Pounding bass.
</p>

<p>
Sweat.
</p>

<p>
Why Leah.
</p>

<p>
Who cares why.
</p>

<p>
You didn‚Äôt stop it. You aren‚Äôt able to help. You can‚Äôt do shit. You‚Äôre
sitting here, making excuses about why you can‚Äôt do anything fucking
useful. Failure. You‚Äôre a fucking failure.
</p>

<p>
More than that, you‚Äôre sending these women to their death. And the
cops are doing less than shit. Just another missing girl. Some ache in
your chest, you deserve it .  It was time to start making up for
pieces you lack. The edges that everyone had told you to sand off were
needed now, more sharply than ever before.
</p>

<p>
You think back to a conversation you had with Kai once upon a
time. What do you love?, he had asked you. How deeply must you feel
your anger before you cannot take it anymore? Before you snap? Except
he had it wrong. He was telling you to let the anger go. That never
felt right. You understood now. You need to channel it. Use it, to
take back everything, inch by inch if you have to. Start
now. Everything can be better. Not in spite of anger. Because of
it. It was good advice, even if it was directionally wrong ‚Äì This was
only the beginning.
</p>

<p>
You slam the rest of your drink back before flipping the guy off and
striding out to your town car.  Time to pay a few people a visit,
starting with Kai who you need to break up with once and for all.  .
When you say goodbye this time, it feels final, in a way it never has
before. He pulls you into him, close, strong and purposeful, and he
kisses you deeply, tenderly and carefully - as if he‚Äôs afraid that
after all this time of making you strong, he might break you. He
kisses you like you are something delicate, something precious, and
something he will never see again.
</p>

<p>
And he won't, as long as it's up to you.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> is nervous about lunch. Alphonse is the closest thing she has
to family. She meets him at TOKii, a trendy, upscale Japanese
restaurant. His giant muscular frame in its usual fitted black t-shirt
and pants should look out of place among the minimalist decor, but he
seems to fit right in.
</p>

<p>
After they order - both getting the special - she notices Alphonse has
been staring at her.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asks, taking a sip of water.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúGet to it.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúI just wanted to see you.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúLike hell.‚Äù He says, leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ leaving the industry for a bit. Going part time. Or.. no
time‚Ä¶‚Äù she finishes quietly, diligently looking at her water glass.
</p>

<p>
The slight smile that he has had this whole time drops in an
instant. He is unable to keep the suspicion out of his voice when he
responds, ‚ÄúOkay. Why?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúFor work.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúWhat kind of work? You‚Äôre leaving work to do work? The fuck - This
about those women?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ sort of.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
He doesn‚Äôt respond or move. Sitting there with his massive arms folded
across his barrel chest, with a scowl forming on his face, he is an
intimidating sight. His jaw clenches, and he inhales and exhales
deeply, slowly.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> knows there are two things going through his mind right now:
When he did R&amp;D for Savage Arms in the 80s, a lot of his work ended
up - unexpectedly - on the black market and with the families. He
knows about the ruthlessness of Boston‚Äôs underground better than most
people. It was one of the darkest times of his life, to be so closely
linked to so much death and violence and he has not been shy about
opining that that‚Äôs who was behind this to <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>. She also knows he
has tried to do breath exercises to control his temper in the past.
</p>

<p>
When he finally speaks, it‚Äôs slow and deathly quiet. ‚Äú<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>, I cannot
deal with you being ‚Ä¶‚Äù exhale ‚Äú&#x2026;the way you are right now, so I‚Äôm
going to ask you to give me the same respect I‚Äôve always given
you. Tell me what you are planning and when you‚Äôll be done.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
She‚Äôs only seen him this angry at her once before ‚Äì When they got into
it about her father a few years ago. She got angry right back that
time though. His husband had to step in to stop them.
</p>

<p>
She drops her voice to barely above a whisper and explains about Vance
<a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a> and how the cops aren‚Äôt doing anything and how she‚Äôs recently
met some people through her ex-cop friend <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> - ‚ÄúRemember you met
her?‚Äù - who had a similar drive to find out what need to be cleaned
up, and clean it the fuck up.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she says ‚ÄòVance <a href="#org640bfd3">Dunham</a>‚Äô, the scowl on Alphonse‚Äôs face
deepens.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> quickly adds, ‚ÄúI know you think I‚Äôm just out for him but I
swear he‚Äôs behind whatever the fuck is happening. You know I know how
to be safe! You know I won‚Äôt do stupid shit.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Alphonse leans forward and replies in an angry whisper through gritted
teeth, ‚ÄúYou do stupid shit all the time. Going after those women is
fucking stupid to begin with. You‚Äôre going to get the information, and
then what? Put a stop to whatever the fuck is going on? Work with the
families? How do you think that‚Äôs going to end, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
The food arrives. <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> doesn‚Äôt say anything, and looks down at her
plate, using every ounce of willpower to keep her face as neutral as
possible and avoid eye contact, but can feel Alphonse watching her. A
few long minutes of silence pass. Eventually, he says, with a tone
that is resigned and tired, ‚ÄúSo what do you want from me, Man? You
don‚Äôt need my permission.‚Äú She looks up at him and is suddenly struck
by how old he looks.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> is silent for a moment before responding softly, ‚ÄúI guess I
wanted to see you before I left.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Alphonse smiles sadly at her, ‚ÄúYou might not come back.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll want to stop working in the clubs permanently..‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúYou know that‚Äôs not what I mean.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúI know.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
Silence again. Alphonse breaks the quiet by clearing his throat,
‚ÄúOkay. Well. Let‚Äôs enjoy the rest of our lunch, since you fucked up
the first bit of it so badly.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> smiles. He moves his hand to hold hers across the table, which
she takes.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he says, sitting up straighter in his seat and picking up his
chopsticks, ‚ÄúTell me about these people you‚Äôre working with.‚Äù

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> and Kai are sitting on the couch, leaning against each other,
comfortable, smiling, while some chef waxes philosophical about umami
on <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>‚Äôs TV. Kai is tracing a finger on the inside of <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>‚Äôs palm
absently. The sun is starting to set outside. They‚Äôve been lounging in
here all weekend, luxuriating in having nothing to do, nowhere to go,
and in each other.
</p>

<p>
He leans over and kisses her cheek, and clears his throat, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù
</p>

<p>
She immediately tenses a little‚Ä¶ Something was up.
</p>

<p>
He doesn‚Äôt seem to have noticed and is continuing to look down,
drawing little circles on the inside of <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>‚Äôs palm with his finger
before slipping his fingers through hers. ‚ÄúDo you think maybe we
should‚Ä¶ tell people this week?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
She can feel him looking at her. She diligently avoids eye-contact,
looking down at their hands, now clasped.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúTell people what?‚Äù she asks with as neutral a tone as she can manage,
knowing exactly what he wanted to tell people.
</p>

<p>
He grins, ‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôll play. We‚Äôve been doing ‚Ä¶ this‚Ä¶ for some time
now. I probably should let Jay know ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs weird about conflicts of
interest‚Ä¶  and you should probably let <a href="#org32714f6">Aurora</a> and Alphonse
know&#x2026; Maybe some of the girls?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
When she doesn‚Äôt say anything and the silence colonizes the room, he
presses, the open smile fading into something guarded. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Man?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
When <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> finally speaks, it is clear she is choosing her words
carefully, deliberately: ‚ÄúWe only need to let them know if we are
serious about each other.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
She wishes he would let go of her hand, but he doesn‚Äôt. Instead, he
sits up straighter and turns toward her. She doesn‚Äôt move, and when
she turns her head, she sees the confused, slightly hurt expression on
his face. Oh fuck.
</p>

<p>
She immediately sits up straighter and turns to him.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúI just ‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶ When did we get serious, Kai?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
The hurt expression on his face changes to an incredulous scowl, ‚ÄúAre
you kidding right now, Man? I thought we‚Äôd been serious for‚Ä¶ a fucking
while.‚Äù His volume is rising slightly, and the smile has vanished. He
hasn‚Äôt let go of her hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not seeing anyone else, I haven‚Äôt for
months. I‚Äôm trying to figure out my work so I can see you more and
maybe even live together. I‚Äôve told my fucking parents about you. And
you don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre serious?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
A lump has risen in her throat and there is an odd pain in her
chest. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ am not seeing anyone else,‚Äù she says, weakly.
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúWell, fuck, that‚Äôs so generous of you.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
‚ÄúKai, I just ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand ‚Ä¶ this is so perfect. We‚Äôre having a
ton of fun! You never cared how much of my life you had before, why
does it suddenly matter?‚Äù
</p>

<p>
He lets go of her hand and his tone is cold and angry, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ never
cared? It fucking wrecked me, <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a>. Every single fucking time you
didn‚Äôt call or‚Ä¶ or‚Ä¶ want to talk to me after we ‚Ä¶. I thought we were
past all that.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
<a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> looks at him, hurt, confused, a little angry at being put in a
position that she did not agree to: ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I thought‚Ä¶‚Äù
</p>

<p>
What does she want to say, she doesn‚Äôt even know‚Ä¶ All she knows is she
wants this fight to stop and for him to hold her again. She stops
talking. Something has broken in this moment and she doesn‚Äôt know
what.
</p>

<p>
He is watching her intently with those deep brown eyes. He takes her
hand and puts it on his cheek, holding it there. When he broaches the
silence, his voice is low, quiet, soothing ‚Äì a question, even if it
didn‚Äôt sound like one ‚Äì a tone you would adopt with a cornered
animal. ‚ÄúMan‚Ä¶‚Äú
</p>

<p>
She feels his stubble under her palm as he presses on, ‚ÄúBaby. It‚Äôs
me. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre worried about, but I promise I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt
even know‚Ä¶ I just know I want to figure this out with you.‚Äù
</p>

<p>
She puts her other hand on his face and pulls in him for a kiss,
crying. Why was she crying? What was this lump in her throat? Why
couldn‚Äôt she say what she wanted to say?
</p>

<p>
The next few hours are spent in a tangle of hushed whispers,
declarations of lust and almost-love, limbs, blankets, and sighs.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, Kai is gone before <a href="#org6a1598d">Manasi</a> wakes up. She doesn‚Äôt
call. He doesn‚Äôt either.
